# Singing-Horse

Many years ago, a bold thief broke into the stables of the Tsar of all the Russias, and tried to steal the Tsar's prize stallion.
Caught, he was dragged before the Tsar, who reviled him, saying "Accursed ruffian! You will pay for your impudence with your life!
Have you any last words?" The thief, unabashed, said "Your Highness, you can have me killed, but what will you gain in the bargain?
Instead, spare my life for one year, and I'll teach your horse to sing! You'll  be the envy of every prince in Christendom!"
The Tsar laughed until tears ran down his cheeks, and said "Reckless knave! You gamble with your own fate! Very well! I will spare your life.
If, in a year, you can teach the horse to sing, I'll grant you your freedom. On the other hand, if you fail, your death will be all
the more terrible! Take him away!" The captain of the Tsar's guards took the thief's arm and led him toward the stables, hissing "You fool!
You've condemned yourself! Nobody can teach a horse to sing!" The thief replied, "You may be right, but a lot can happen in a year. The Tsar
may change his mind. The horse may die. The Tsar may die. Or, who knows? The horse may learn to sing!"
